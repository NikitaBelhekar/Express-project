Introduction
myContact is a web application designed to manage and organize personal and professional contacts efficiently. Built using Express.js and Node.js, this app provides users with a simple, user-friendly interface to store, retrieve, and manage contact information. With features like adding new contacts, editing existing ones, and deleting outdated information, myContact offers an intuitive solution for managing both small and large contact lists.

This project leverages the power of Express.js, a lightweight framework for Node.js, to handle the server-side logic and routing. The app is designed with a RESTful architecture, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, it integrates a database to persist user contact information, ensuring that contacts are stored securely and can be accessed or updated at any time.

The myContact app can be further extended to include features like search functionality, user authentication, and data synchronization with cloud storage, making it a robust solution for modern contact management.
